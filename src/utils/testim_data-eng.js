I myself am a psychologist and I saw another psychologist, but it was Svetlana\'s techniques that helped me put everything in its place. It was especially useful not to focus on the problem and fall into it, but to take it and go further. I\'m now going to play the game “Pocket”.'

Svetlana is sensitive in the session, carefully opening all my hidden problems and gently returning to the children\'s templates. She identified some negative attitudes, changing my attitude to my husband and myself. My family is saved and all this in only for 7 sessions! Thank you, Good luck!'

The inquiry did not take a long time to appear, but when it came out, it was exactly what I did not want to admit to myself, but I had been dreading for a long time! Sveta leads gently and harmoniously, without stress and falling into deep traumas. I was at the other end of the world and I just got what I needed from this game, over skype. Bottom line: 2 weeks have passed, my request has already come true! Good luck and development!'
